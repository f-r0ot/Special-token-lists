# 🔐 Special Tokens in LLMs — Security Research Archive

This repository contains curated lists of **special tokens** used by various **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, collected and analyzed for **security research purposes**.

## 🧠 Purpose

Special tokens—such as control sequences, formatting markers, and reserved vocabulary—can influence model behavior in subtle or undocumented ways. Understanding these tokens is critical for:

- 🔍 Auditing model behavior and prompt injection risks
- 🧪 Fuzzing and adversarial testing
- 🧰 Building robust token-level filters and sanitizers
- 📚 Reverse-engineering tokenizer internals

⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository is intended for educational and research purposes only.

📬 Contributions
Pull requests are welcome! If you've explored special tokens in other models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, Mistral), feel free to share your findings.
